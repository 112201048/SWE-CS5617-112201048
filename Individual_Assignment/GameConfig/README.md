# Singleton Pattern Demo - Java

A demonstration of the **Singleton design pattern** implemented in Java. This project includes modern Java development practices and best software engineering practices including testing, code coverage etc.

### Real-World Applications

The Singleton pattern is commonly used in:

- **Configuration management** (e.g., game configuration, app settings)
- **Logging frameworks** (ensuring all parts of the system use the same logger)
- **Database connections** (ensuring only one connection manager exists)

## üèóÔ∏è Design

This project defines a Game Configuration Manager that demonstrates the Singleton pattern.
The **GameConfigManager** class ensures only one instance of the configuration exists and provides a consistent way for multiple subsystems (such as Renderer, AudioSystem, and DifficultyManager) to access and use game settings.

### Key Components

- **`GameConfigManager`** - The Singleton class that ensures only one instance exists and provides global access to configuration settings.
- **`Renderer`** - A subsystem that uses the shared configuration.
- **`AudioSystem`** - Another subsystem that depends on the same configuration instance.
- **`DifficultyManager`** - Game logic component demonstrating the use of Singleton for loading levels.
- **`App`** - Demonstration class showing how all components share the same Singleton instance.
- **Comprehensive test suite** - Validates pattern implementation
